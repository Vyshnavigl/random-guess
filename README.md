Project Title: Random Guessing of Even and Odd Numbers

Project Description:
The "Random Guessing of Even and Odd Numbers" project is a fun and educational programming project that aims to create a simple game where the user guesses whether a randomly generated number is even or odd. This project is suitable for beginners learning programming concepts and can be implemented in various programming languages such as Python, JavaScript, or Java.

**Project Objectives:**

1. **Random Number Generation:** Implement a mechanism to generate random numbers within a specified range.
2. **User Interaction:** Develop a user-friendly interface that allows users to input their guesses (even or odd) for each generated number.
3. **Logic Evaluation:** Write code to determine whether the generated number is even or odd and compare it with the user's guess.
4. **Scoring System:** Keep track of the user's score by counting the number of correct guesses.
5. **Game Loop:** Create a loop that continues generating numbers and accepting user guesses until the user decides to exit the game.
6. **User Experience:** Enhance the user experience with clear instructions and feedback after each guess.

**Project Components:**
1. **Random Number Generator:** Use a random number generator function/library to generate random integers within a specific range.
2. **User Interface:** Create a simple console or GUI interface to interact with the user, displaying the randomly generated number and accepting their guess.
3. **Logic and Validation:** Implement logic to check whether the generated number is even or odd and validate the user's input.
4. **Score Tracking:** Maintain a score counter to keep track of the user's correct guesses.
5. **Game Loop:** Implement a loop that continues generating numbers and accepting guesses until the user decides to quit.
6. **Feedback:** Provide feedback to the user after each guess, indicating whether they were correct or not.
7. **Exit Mechanism:** Allow the user to exit the game when they choose to do so.

**Optional Enhancements:**
1. **Time Limit:** Add a time limit for each guess to increase the challenge.
2. **Leaderboard:** Implement a leaderboard to store and display high scores.
3. **Sound Effects and Graphics:** Enhance the user experience with sound effects and simple graphics.
4. **Multiplayer Mode:** Enable a multiplayer mode where users can compete against each other.
5. **Difficulty Levels:** Add different difficulty levels with varying ranges of numbers.
